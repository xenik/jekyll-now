title: win cmd commands 
---

Hi there!
I didnt write last two days.. Monday, I was at home, cause I was ill yet.
But I had been working about 7 hours o'clock and did many many person deals)))
I am really loved such days. I think I really need to go to remote work or free graphic work.
Cause i very tired to spend so many hours on the way to work and back to home each days...

so, what about I say...
win cmd which I have opened today :)

1) CLS = clear screen cmd
usefull for me, but I prefer a terminal in Linux :)

2) ECHO.%PATH:;= & ECHO.% 
i have a problem with GIT package for sublime_text_3 and i decided to check path to git..
so what I looked for pretty print for that action :)
